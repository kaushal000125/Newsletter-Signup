# Newsletter-Signup
I am not uploading "node_modules" because it contain more than 100 sub-files and of very big size.
So to  run this project you need to download these files on your local server(hyper etc.) and then excute it.
Step- first install npm package by writing---->npm install //if npm not installed on your device
